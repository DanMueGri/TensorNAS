# Convolutional Layers

Convolutional layers towards the begining of a model should have fewer filters while those towards the end should have more.
Maybe a constraint such as conv_layer[0].filter_count <= conv_layer[x+1].filter_count would be smart.

Kernel size must be odd

Increasing size of stride can replace pooling to reduce spatial dimentions of the output volume

specifying any dilation_rate value != 1 is incompatible with specifying any stride value != 1.
